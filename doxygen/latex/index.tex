If you want, you can add flags to the line above, which will be discussed below. Enter three numbers, separated by spaces. These three numbers are the coefficients of the quadratic equation, starting with the highest coefficient. Get the correct answer and realize that real men solve the square not by Vieta, but by {\ttfamily RT\+\_\+equation\+\_\+solver}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{Flags}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
{\ttfamily -\/-\/help} or {\ttfamily -\/h} prints information how to use falgs. Example of displaying information in the console



--do\+\_\+test or -\/d turns on testing of the program with results output. An example of displaying successful test execution in the console



An example of displaying failed tests in the console



--only\+\_\+test or -\/o disables solving equations with input coefficients, disables input of coefficients An example of how this flag works
